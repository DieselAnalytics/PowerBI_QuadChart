# Custom Quad Chart Visual in Power BI using ggplot2

Power BI enables you to create custom visualizations using R. In this repo I demostrate how you can use the R programming language to create a quad chart in Power BI. The data used in the demo is NFL combine data. I use filters in Power BI to select the year and position that I want to based the quad chart on and R to create the visualization.

A complete coverage of the code is contained in the ***Create_Custom_Visualizations_in_PowerBI_with_ggplot2*** Jupyter Notebook. PBI_QuadChart is the pbix file that contains the Power BI example.

Resources:

- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/): I believe this book is the best introduction to the R programming language.

- [Guy in a Cube](https://guyinacube.com/): Great YouTube for all things Power BI. Patrick and Adam does a group job of keeping you informed with what's new in Power BI and they also provide great tutorials on how to use the tool.

- [Excel on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZgOVykPoRbSZQfY9YysiRQ):  Oz does a great job creating a tutorials on how to use Power Query for data munging.

- [Mico Yuk](http://bibrainz.com/aof/author/micoyuk/): Mico Yuk provides great training on how to effectively use data visualization to tell amazing stories about your data.

In addition to the resources above I plan to add content covering how you can leverage R in Power BI as well as in the rest of the Microsoft ecosystem in my [blog](https://dieselanalytics.com/). Be on the look out!
